    "content": "What COVID travel measures are in place in France?\n\nMeasures may vary from non-UK origins - check local guidance.\n\nFrom the UK, see current measures. You can enter France from the UK if you:\n\n\n  Complete a “sworn statement”.\n  Prove that you’ve been fully vaccinated, and your last dose was less than nine months ago. If you are 18+, and your last dose was more than nine months ago, you will NOT be considered fully vaccinated unless you have also received a booster.\n  Since 12 Feb you no longer need to present proof of a negative test before you travel if you’re fully vaccinated.\n\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nThe only event with a dress code is on Saturday.\n\nOur theme is “Riviera Chic”. Think linen, open collars, sandals &amp; midi dresses.\n\nIt’s likely going to be hot, with an average daytime temp of 27°C, so don’t feel the need to wear a suit. If it’s a scorcher, shorts are encouraged (we want you to enjoy yourself, not suffer!).\n\nIf you want to take a dip in the pool make sure to bring your swimmers!\n\nCan I bring my kids?\n\nWe really do love kids, however the Saturday events will be adults and babes-in-arms only (if this applies to you please let us know on the RSVP). To organise a babysitter, call or text Marlene at +33 6 83 47 46 43. Feel free to bring your kids to events on Friday and Sunday.\n\nCan I bring a plus one?\n\nPlease check your invite!\n\nIs the wedding outdoors?\n\nAssuming the weather is good, the ceremony will be outdoors. Dinner will be served in the marquee. The grounds are pretty amazing, so expect to walk around outside.\n\nWho made the website?\n\nArchie, of course 😀\n\nI have another question\n\nJust ask us!\n",
